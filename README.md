# Covid-19 Tracker App
This is web-based app to show the COVID-19 Statistics using the Map


I developed the JavaScript, and Angular Js based COVID-19 app that shows statistics over the Map. This App feature includes
1.    Fetch real time data
2.    Show total cases
3.    Search by Country
4.    On click, event Map shows the statistics information
5.    Shows all country sort by alphabetically
